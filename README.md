## Hi, I'm Vedant 👋

I am an IT undergraduate specializing in Machine Learning and MLOps, focused on building production-ready ML systems, not just models.

My work centers around:

Designing end-to-end ML pipelines

Handling real-world challenges like class imbalance, monitoring, and data drift

Deploying and operating models in cloud environments (AWS)

I am particularly interested in fraud detection, ML infrastructure, and applied AI systems, where reliability, observability, and maintainability matter as much as model accuracy.

This project reflects how I approach ML engineering: from data to deployment, with production constraints in mind.
